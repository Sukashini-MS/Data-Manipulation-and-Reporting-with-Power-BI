# Data-Manipulation-and-Reporting-with-Power-BI

## Project Overview:
      Zomato is a restaurant aggregation and meal delivery service based in India. It is currently operating in several countries across the world. Zomato provides thorough information about numerous eateries as well as consumer reviews. Zomato's owners aim to find hidden irregularities in their company's data. 

## Objective:
     To construct a consolidated and interactive Power BI report that will allow Zomato to quickly assess the required data.

## Clients Requirement:
    The clients want to construct a consolidated and interactive Power BI report that will allow them to do the following:
     - Derive data on the total number of restaurants worldwide, including continents, countries, and cities.
     - View data on a global scale with the capacity to drill down to a granular level.
     - Derive data on the restaurants with the highest average customer ratings.
     - Discover the restaurants with the lowest average costs.

## Industry Relevance:

     • Constructing a consolidated and interactive Power BI:    It enables evaluating each data set by connecting them, and it also helps in analyzing the findings in the form of charts or graphs.

     • Understand DAX and its application:    It is a set of functions and algorithms that create computed columns, measures, and custom tables in Microsoft Power BI.

## Problem Statement:

     1. Filter and view information on the restaurants based on:

Their geographical dimensions such as continent, country, and city.
The service they provide, such as online ordering or reservation services.
The average rating slab by color.
     2. Identify the restaurants with the most cuisines served.

     3. Design a multi-page report that suits Zomato's theme with easy navigation across sections.

## Tasks Performed:

     1. Imported the data from all available excel files.

     2. Transformed the data and removed any columns that aren't being used.

     3. Created two columns to display the restaurant name and restaurant address.

     4. Made a separate table for the list of the cuisines that each restaurant serves.

     5. Created a dimension table, the country-code table which contain only unique and non-blank value.

     6. Created the relationship model for interconnecting the tables.

     7. Used DAX by adding a rating colour column in an appropriate table

     8. Created required measures by using the DAX.

     9. Identified the required KPI's and created the required visualizations

    10. By using these visualization created a multi-page report with easy navigaion icons.

    11. Designed a dynamic user-friendly dashboard. 

## Project Outcome:

       As per the clients requirement, a consolidated and interactive Power BI multi-page report is visualized that will allow Zomato to quickly assess the required data.
